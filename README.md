# Gaia Deep Space Observer
The [Gaia Space Telescope](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/gaia-space-observatory/) has been collecting unprecedented detail about the stars all around us. Since 2013 the telescope has been making incredibly precise measurements to track not only the distance to more stellar object than we've ever known before -- but also the spectrographic data and apparent motion of the bodies through space.

## View the stars in astounding detail
